Have owned the Equinox for 6 months now and all in all is a great value. We purchased an '07 1LT with the 17" chrome wheels, which make it look great. I like the sporty look, ride and handling, but, im not that impressed with the gas mileage, I get the same mileage with a 2000 grand cherokee as this. I also hate the recessed windshield, it is a pain in the rear to brush snow off, my hood is scratched and chipped after one winter.
Sporty look, comfort, overall value, radio with multiband memory presets. Very roomy back seat
