I bought my Prius used from a limo company. Got a great deal because they took good care of it. I am 6'5 and 240 lbs. and fit fine. It's a great car and I have a lot of fun with it. The pickup is good for a 4 cylinder and better when Premium gas is used. Gotta love it when I fill up the tank with premium for $25 and drive 450 miles. My wife owns a Lexus SUV and we take my car more often than hers. I'd buy another one but a new one next time. 
Keyless start. Technologically updated. Good sound system. 45 mpg. Roomy interior.
