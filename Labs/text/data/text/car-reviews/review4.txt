Love the car, hate having Toyota as my mom. The limitation of the navigation system are stupid. Having to acknowledge "I accept" everytime you start the car is ridiculous. But even more annoying is that your passengers cannot program the nav system while the car is in motion. Driving down the road with my wife we decide we want to get something to eat. Toyota makes you pull to the side of the freeway and stop (endangering life and property) and then do your navigation. By the time you work this out you can drive through most towns and find a place to eat without the navigation system. The lack of an aux input for the stereo system in this day and age is just plain dumb.
