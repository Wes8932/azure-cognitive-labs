    "*Personalizer* is a service that allows the application to chooise the best **single** content item to show to the user. Personalizer uses reinforcement learning techniques to enable the selection of the best item is based on the features about the content and the context. The selection is based on the collective behaviour and the reward score for all the users. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Azure Personalizer** cognitive service in Microsoft Azure provides a cloud-based solution for creating personalized journeys for the users..\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a Personalizer resource\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the Personalizer service, you need an Azure resource that you can use to train a model, and a resource with which you can publish it for applications to use. Unlike other congnitive services you will need to use one resource for every task you create. It would not be advisable to merge different content, or actions within the same resource. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. In a new browser tab, open the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.\n",
    "2. Select the **&#65291;Create a resource** button, search for *personalizer*, and create a **Personalizer** resource with the following settings:\n",
    "    - **Name**: *Enter a unique name*\n",
    "    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*\n",
    "    - **Location**: *Choose any available region*\n",
    "    - **Pricing tier**: F0\n",
    "    > **Note**: F0 tiers allows you about 50K transactions a month, that would be sufficient when you try out, but for all practical purposes you will need to setup a **S0** tier to be of any utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Wait for deployment to complete. Then go to your cognitive services resource, and on the **Overview** page, click the link to manage the keys for the service. You will need the endpoint and keys to connect to your cognitive services resource from client applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get the Key and Endpoint for your Personalizer resource\n",
    "\n",
    "To use your cognitive services resource, client applications need its  endpoint and authentication key:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the Azure portal, on the **Keys and Endpoint** page for your personalizer resource, copy the **Key1** for your resource and paste it in the code below, replacing **YOUR_PER_KEY**.\n",
    "2. Copy the **endpoint** for your resource and and paste it in the code below, replacing **YOUR_PER_ENDPOINT**.\n",
